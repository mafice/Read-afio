Afio has far too many options to be used directly from the command
line, it is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup
script.


1) Using an existing script.

There are a number of backup scripts using afio that I know of.
Apart from incorporating the functions of afio, such scripts offer
some general `administrative structure' like backup volumes, file
exclusion, log files and incremental backup facilities.

The available scripts have some large differences in the type of
backup device they were primarily designed for (from floppy to network
attached tape), the amount of maintenance done on them, and presumably
the amount of remaining bugs.

A list of scripts that use afio:

This list was last updated Dec 2003 -- I have only listed scripts
for which I found some evidence that they are (still) maintained.

2) Writing your own backup script. (Or adapting an existing one.)

Aside from the manual page, the files README.afio, README.linux,
and script*/* provide information for script writers.

Three sample backup scripts are included with this afio release.  The
material in script1/ is written by Andrew Stevens, that in script2/ by
Dave Gymer. All scripts will probably need some editing to run on your
configuration.

Sample scripts for backups with pgp encryption are included in
script3/.  There were contributed by Karsten Ballueder.

Sample scripts for backups with GnuPG (gpg) encryption are also
included in script3/.  There were based on contributions by Jens Getreu.

A sample script for use with the -H option is included in
script4/. This script was provided by Raphael Manfredi.
