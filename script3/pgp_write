# This example shows how to configure afio to write pgp encrypted archives.
#
# Setting the PGPPASS environment variable is unsafe.
# 
# If you are using bash, you can use the input redirection by opening a second
# input stream linked to a file containing your pass phrase. Be careful about
# that file's permissions!
#
# working with any shell, but unsafe:
#
#export PGPPASS="your pass phrase"
#find * | afio -ov -Z -U -P "pgp" -Q "-fe" -Q "user_id_for_encryption" -Q "y" archive_file
#
# better, only working with bash(?):
#
export PGPPASSFD=3
find * | afio -ov -Z -U -P "pgp" -Q "-fe" -Q "user_id_for_encryption" -3 3 archive_file 3<passphrasefile

#WARNING: I (Koen Holtman) do not have pgp so I have not tested the above.
#If pgp has a property of being able to produce different-length output
#files when used twice on the same input, as gpg has, then the above script
#will sometimes cause errors in the backup.
